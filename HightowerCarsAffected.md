# Cellular CDMA G2 Sunset - GM-Canada Solution to Retain OnStar Functionality in Affected Vehicles 

Canada sunseted cellular G2 CDMA technology in 2015. GM Canada figured out how to retain OnStar functionality in affected vehicles without using a dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port, which is GM USA solution. Documents retrieved from NHTSA (US) https://nhtsa.gov.

### 2011 Chevrolet HHR Sunroof Repair 
The following is not related to the cellular companies in America sunseting cellular CDMA G2 technology. However, since I created this document for the OnStar G2 shutdown, this is a handy place to put it.

This frame is needed because the driver side pivot hold down is broken. When the sunroof is retracted, the slide arm that is supposed lower the wind baffle springs up, requiring two people to close the sunroof: 
1. one person is needed outside to hold the arm down for the window
2. the other person is needed inside to push the button to close the sunroof.
